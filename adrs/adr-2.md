Architecture Design: HealthSync Telemedicine Platform1. System OverviewHealthSync is a web and mobile platform allowing doctors to conduct video consultations with patients, view digital health records, and issue electronic prescriptions.2. Technical ComponentsWeb Frontend: A React application hosted on AWS S3/CloudFront.API Gateway: A single Nginx instance acting as a reverse proxy.User Service: A Python FastAPI service handling authentication and profiles.Consultation Service: A Node.js service managing video metadata and scheduling.Primary Database: A single PostgreSQL instance running on an EC2 virtual machine.File Storage: A local disk folder on the Consultation Service server for storing patient medical reports (PDFs).3. Interaction MapPatient $\rightarrow$ API Gateway (HTTPS/Port 443).API Gateway $\rightarrow$ User Service (HTTP/Port 8000).User Service $\rightarrow$ PostgreSQL (Standard SQL connection).Consultation Service $\rightarrow$ Local Storage (File I/O) to save PDFs.External Video Provider (Daily.co) $\rightarrow$ Consultation Service (Webhook notifications).4. Technical Constraints & RequirementsTraffic: Expecting 500 concurrent video sessions during peak morning hours.Performance: Medical records must load in under 2 seconds.Security: Must comply with basic health data privacy standards. All user passwords are encrypted using MD5.5. Deployment StrategyThe system is currently deployed on a single large AWS EC2 instance using Docker Compose to simplify the management of all services in one place.
