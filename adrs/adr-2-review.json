  "deep_dive": "The current architecture of the HealthSync Telemedicine Platform presents significant challenges in terms of both performance and security. The reliance on single instances for critical services, such as the API Gateway and User Service, creates multiple single points of failure (SPOFs) that jeopardize service continuity. Furthermore, the synchronous processing model in the Consultation Service leads to CPU bottlenecks, particularly during peak usage times, which can severely degrade user experience. To address these issues, it is essential to adopt a more resilient architecture that includes load balancing, asynchronous processing, and a move towards stateless services. Additionally, the security posture must be strengthened by implementing robust authentication mechanisms, enforcing secure data transmission protocols, and instituting comprehensive access controls to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches."
